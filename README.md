# t-shirt design for rubytij

Did not included the font `American TypeWriter` due to licensing issues on redistribution but you can look up on the Internet, that is the official I Love New York type face.

There is also a folder `ruby-logo-kit` which has all official ruby logos which we can redistribute.

The logo was created with [Inkscake](http://www.inkscape.org) in SVG format which pretty much all vector applications can open.
